# Species Attributes

* Species_ID: a unique identifier for each species.
* Life_span: a constant that defines the average life span of each species.
```markdown
I am not sure we want to define the (average or max) life span of the species.
We could just simply add a probability of death. 
On the other hand, starting with a fix maximum (or average) could be good.
(I.e., it makes sure there will be no infinitely living individuals.)
```
* Full_energy: a constant that defines the maximum energy level of each species.
```markdown
Full energy -- same here: we may not want to define a maximum. 
We may rather define a function of 'storage or aquiring effectiveness'. 
I.e., if you already have 10000 units, it will be less likely for you to have one more.
But again, as an initial draft we can start with a fixed value here.
```
* Mature_stage: an interval that individuals of this species can reproduce.
```markdown
Mature stage: again, an interval may be too strict. We want to learn this. 
But as a starter, having it this ways is OK.
```
* Maximum_reproduction: a constant that defines the maximum number of offspring that an individual can produce.
```markdown
Maximum-repro: agian, this is strict. I would rather have it defined indirectly. 
But as a starter: OK.
```
* Reproduction_cost: a constant that defines the energy cost of reproduction.
```markdown
Repro cost: probably OK.
```


# Individual Attributes
* Type_ID: the same as Species_ID, but for individuals.
* Remaining_life: a constant which is randomly generated from the species Life_span.
```markdown
See as above, I would rather have this emerge probabilistically. 
Nonetheless, we can start this way.
```
* Energy: a constant which is randomly generated from the species Full_energy.
```markdown
I am not sure I understand this. 
The energy level is supposed to depend on what the individual has eaten, not randomly generated.
```
* Sex: Male or Female.
```markdown
I would simplify things by NOT having sexual reproduction.
(I.e., there would be no sexes and any individual would be able to reproduce with every other.)
```
* Is_Mature: a boolean value that indicates whether the individual is mature or not.
* Mating_Rank: a float number between 0 and 1, which is randomly generated from a uniform distribution. It represents the score of an individual in the mating pool. The higher the score, the more likely the individual will be chosen as a mate.
```markdown
That is an interesting approach. 
But it also carries an important assumption about how mating is done or how the mating partner is selected. 
(See more below, discussing interactions.)
```
* Reproduction_ability: an integer between 0 and Maximum_reproduction.
```markdown
See as above and as below.
My idea would be that reproduction ability and #offspring depends on a number of variables and circumstances and not an explicit variable. 
I mean, something like these would be a function of the guy's energy level, the circumstances of the interaction 
(i.e., how many competing individuals for a mating opportunity, etc.). Nonetheless, having some 'inherited property' that influences this is OK.
```
* Number_of_offspring: an integer between 0 and Reproduction_ability.
```markdown
See the previous point.
```
* Reproduction_cost: a constant which is the same as the species Reproduction_cost.
```markdown
If I understand correctly, this is energy 'spent' by reproduction (and/or on producing/raising the offspring).
```
* Natural_death_rate: an interval that the probability of an individual dying of natural causes is randomly generated from.
```markdown
OK, but I am not sure how this corresponds to the average life span parameter discussed above.
```
* (x,y): the location of the individual in the grid.
* Is_Dead: a boolean value that indicates whether the individual is dead or not.

# Interaction

Let's say species A = Rabbit, species B = Fox, species C = Wolf.
What will happen when two individuals of the same species meet?
```markdown
What alternatives do we have in mind? 
I would normally think that they either reproduce or not.
However, we may also consider other types of activities. 
E.g., one could try to eat the other (if we allow for cannibalism). 
However, I have the gut feeling that this may complicate the potential foodweb unnecessarily and it will probably not be very useful for an evolving foodweb. 
On the other hand, we may think of some kind of possible aggression (i.e., a 3rd type of activity). 
The possible benefit of this could be that if the density of a species becomes too high, they might to encounter more and more aggression, somehow hurting each other and thus limiting their overall growth. 
But this is just an idea.
 
```
Any idea we have?
What will happen when Species A meets Species B? If B kills A, how much energy will B gain? How much energy will B lose during the fight?
```markdown
Generally, my answer to the first part of the question would be:
i) we have the same option in all combinations, I think. I.e., A meeting A, A meeting B, A meeting C -- should not be very different. 
Except, perhaps, that mating is only possible within the same species.
ii) This approach (i.e., putting 'meeting' in the driver's seat) is different from what we had in the NetLogo model, but this may be good. 
I mean, in the NetLogo model, each agent went through a list of fixed actions (move, eat, die if too weak, reproduce, etc.). 
Here, we rather seem to be saying that what each agent does in each round is moving and encountering certain agents and then we will have rules on what is happening then. 
But that may be fine.
```
 
```markdown
As for the second part of the question, we will need to work out the details of the fight, the eating (metabolism), reproduction, etc. 
We must do this in a very flexible way, such that we can experiment with the options and learn what works best.
```

What will happen when Species A meets Species C?
What will happen when Species B meets Species C?
```markdown
Answered above.
```
What will happen when 5 individuals of Species A meet a single individual of Species B?
```markdown
This is also a nice idea. So, instead of doing a 1:1 interaction with everyone encountered, we could do an N:M type of encounter. 
Or, at least, this could be one alternative that we experiment with.
```

What will happen when two different species are very near to each other? Will the weaker one escape? How much is the escape distance and probability?
```markdown
See as above. We should work out this in a general way, but in a way that allows for many alternative versions. 
I do not think we want to implement the details of the fight (i.e., skills, escaping, etc.), but rather a model based on functions and probabilities.
```

How do two individuals choose each other as mates? Do they choose the closest one? Or the one with the highest Mating_Rank? Or the one with the highest energy level?

```markdown
We need to come up with a rather generic formulation that allows for all these (and more). Then, we want to experiment (or optimise -- finding the combination of rules that gives the best results).

```
Where will the offspring be born? At the location of the mother? Or at a random location nearby?
```markdown
Or even, a purely random location. -- We do not want to decide on this. We want the system to learn what is yielding the best overall solution.
```

How do the lowest species in the food chain interact with plants? What is the growth rate of plants?
```markdown
These are parameters. But we do need to have a (re-)growth mechanism.
```

Does the environment have an impact on the interaction? For example, if the environment is a desert, will the growth rate of plants be lower? Or if the environment is a forest, will the growth rate of plants be higher?
```markdown
There definitely must be a growth rate parameter. And maybe a parameter specifying how easy it is to move in the environment. But otherwise, I would keep the influence of the environment minimal at this point.
```
Speaking of the search radius, should we define the speed and the search radius of each species?
```markdown
Or for each individual, too. 
I think, this is also a parameter/option that we need to play with.
Also, the speed my be dependent on age, or on energy level, or both. We need a form that is very flexible and that allows us to experiment with it (automatically).
```
Does the speed related to individual's current energy level and age?
etc.

```markdown
See as above.
